Morphing Book examples in Processing

These are a series of processing sketches that explore example listed in [Morphing by Joseph Choma](https://www.amazon.com/Morphing-Mathematical-Transformations-Architects-Designers/dp/1780674139/)

The examples shown in the book are great, but the 3d examples provide only one perspective and I felt they needed to be explored further. 

Some notes:
- Folder numbers refer to pages in the book (with dashes corresponding to the number of images on each page where applicable)
- Folders with letters are often me playing around and tweaking variables, YMMV with them
- not all examples are accounted for here—if I was interested in the shape in the book I wrote it up. If you’d like to submit additional examples please submit a PR
- Most sketches aren’t very performant. I rewrote them to be better as I progressed. I recommend looking at later examples that use the Wave class if you’re interested in performance upgrades.
- variable naming conventions are meant to reflect conventions used in the book
